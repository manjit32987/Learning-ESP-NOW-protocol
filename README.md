# ESP32 Peer-to-Peer Communication with ESP-NOW

This project demonstrates how to establish wireless peer-to-peer communication between two ESP32 boards using the ESP-NOW protocol. ESP-NOW is a fast, connectionless communication protocol developed by Espressif that allows devices to exchange data without a traditional Wi-Fi connection.

## Features
- 📡 ESP-NOW Peer-to-Peer Communication
- ⚡ Efficient, Low-Latency Data Transfer
- 🔐 MAC Address-Based Device Targeting
- 🚫 No Wi-Fi Router Required

## Hardware Required
- 2x ESP32 Development Boards
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires (for additional components, if needed)

## Setup
1. Upload the `sender.ino` sketch to one ESP32 board (Transmitter).
2. Upload the `receiver.ino` sketch to another ESP32 board (Receiver).
3. Use the Serial Monitor to view MAC addresses and monitor data exchange.
